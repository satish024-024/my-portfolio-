            JNTUA Results Analyzer was a revolutionary tool designed to simplify
            and enhance the experience of accessing academic results. It served
            as a powerful proxy between the JNTUA university results website and
            its users, offering a range of features that made result analysis
            faster and more efficient. Here&apos;s what made it stand out:

              Unfortunately, as of May 2022, the tool stopped working due to the
              introduction of CAPTCHA on the official JNTUA results site, which
              disrupted the seamless functionality of the app. JNTUA Results
              Analyzer transformed the way students and faculty interacted with
              academic results, making it a must-have tool until its unexpected
              shutdown.
